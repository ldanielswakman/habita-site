There were many thoughts and ideas flying around in our minds. Ali was the one to put them on paper and bring them to life. It took a very short time for us to look at the same direction and share the vision. We said living, living, living instead of working, working, working. So thats how habita was born out of latin root habitus.

Our logo was the next step. Before all we said “to share”;

Then we said “it multiplies and expands as we share”;

Last but not the least, it converged with habita…
