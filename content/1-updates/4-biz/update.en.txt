Born in Ankara, raised in Mersin, lives in Istanbul. Graduated from Tarsus Amerikan College which he thinks he owes almost everyhting to. Bilkent, Bocconi and finally corporate life started with Mag Consulting followed by IBM and ended with Hay Group. Didn’t know anything but consulting. Never really hated corporate life but always wanted to feel happier. Believes where you live, work and feel attached changes people a lot and sharing constantly renovates these environments. Loves food (eating, talking about and dreaming about the food), horses and all kinds of sports slightly more than any other thing.

According to Serdar, who is an alumni of Bilkent and Cornell Universities, road to happiness passes through seeing different places, meeting new people and doing creative things.

Serdar's entrepreneurial soul and energy came to life with habita. Currently he is excited with and enjoying every moment of this process, where his starting point to make his dream come true was: " The road is the goal"

Burak was born and raised in Mersin. After being graduated from Tarsus American College, he studied Chemical Engineering at İstanbul Technical University and Marketing Management at Middlesex University respectively. Although Burak has always carried the entrepreneurial spirit, which he has inherited from his father, after his graduation he had experienced the corporate life by being assigned at different positions of the sales departments of Stemcor, BP, Prista. When he finally realized the inadequacy of the corporate life in terms of gaining experience, he had his own start-up, though unseccesful. He started believing that the success of the individuals lies in sharing and interaction and he thinks he can realize this with habita. He is interested in everything that involves science and people.
