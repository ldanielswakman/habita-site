Doesn’t matter if you work for the largest company in the world, as a freelancer or a start up…
No matter what, there is something for everyone in habita who wants to feel happier while working, need for a fresh breath and most importantly wants to be a part of an ecosystem where “good things” are created alltogether…

Fixed desks at the open space, closed offices and flexible working places…Waiting for new habitans!
