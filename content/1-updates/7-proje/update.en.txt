After being convinced that this is will be our space, the next question for us was: Who will make our dream space come to physical reality? We met with number of great architects, which all would have done a great job, but listened to our inner voices and chose to work with (link: http://www.pab.com.tr/ text: Pınar and Burçin target: blank).

It took a very short time for us to agree on the idea that our project should take its inspiration from the industrial neighbourhood we are in. Now we see what a great choice we made!

On a side note, we also appreciate them for boosting Levent's mood by reserving this **yellow chair** for him during the meetings we held at their office.
