habita has been designed as a living space bringing forward sharing culture,creativity and positive energy in every aspect of life.

For us, stress can simply be described as the distance between where you are at the moment and where you want to be. habita is born out of the dream to shorten this distance as much as possible by providing a climate in which everyone who shares its atmosphere feels more happy, more peaceful and more creative.

Most important element of this dream is making habita not just a working space but a living environment where culture of sharing prevails in every aspect of life. Together with people sharing the same view of life regardless of their backgrounds and professions.Step by step and always togetherâ€¦
