3 people who somehow managed to kick themselves out of sharp-edged borders of corporate life an deven bureaucracy (Serdar, Burak and Levent) Since the very first moment we had a shared dream of what we want to do: Being part of an expanding and growing environment as people with high potential and energy who feels happy even when they work.

So we hit the road but actually a good friend of us showed us where to lead; Yaşar Adanalı. He is an urbanist and he has an humble space in Karaköy called Le Büro. If there was no Le Büro there may never be habita. He was the one who showed us this beatiful world. There we started to think, work and most importantly to dream…
