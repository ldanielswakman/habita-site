We work to make a dream come true. Very exciting, very entertaining, but lets admit it – very tiring. No matter what you do, sometimes you just have to get away. We are three friends, all from Mersin; so we took a weekend off and flew to a place where feel peaceful, at home… Life is beatiful, also when it's slow. Have to remember that from time to time.
