Convinced that this is going to be our space the next question was who will bring our dream space into physical reality? We met with number of great architects which we still believe every single one of them would have done a great job, we listen to our inner voices and chose to work with Pınar and Burçin.

 It took a very short time for us to share the idea that our project should get its inspiration from the industrial neighbourhood we are in. Now we see what a great choice we made!

We also appreciate them for boosting Levent's mood by reserving this yellow chair for him during the meetings we held at their office.
