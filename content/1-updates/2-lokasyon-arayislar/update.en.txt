We got more and more excited as we started to know more about this world. We hit the streets of Istanbul to find the place we dream of. Started from Balat and we drew a line passing through Karaköy, Kabataş, Beşiktaş,Levent, Sanayi Mahallesi and finally Maslak.

Took us 5 months, and hundreds of kilometers. Got tired, eat at many local special taste stops, thought for days and finally decided that we need be among Istanbul’s most productive ateliers, studios and many other work places from variety of professions. We said we have to be at this industrial neighbourhood which we think it is a natural coworking circle itself as we passed by every single atelier.
