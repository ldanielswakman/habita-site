"A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?" - Albert Einstein

Maybe we don't have a violin for now, but we are trying to do our best to build a habitus for you in which you will feel happy to work. This week our tables, specially designed by our architects, have started to be manufactured. In the mean time, we made a field survey for your office chairs, visited dozens of manifacturers, tried almost hundred different models/branches.

Although the process was very exhausting, the purpose was your comfort and mission is completed! habita's brand new office chairs are on their way and waiting for you!
