We got more and more excited as we started to know more about this strange new world. We hit the streets of Istanbul to find the place we dreamed of. We started from Balat, and we drew a line passing through Karaköy, Kabataş, Beşiktaş, Levent, Sanayi Mahallesi and finally, Maslak.

It took us 5 months, and hundreds of kilometers. We got tired, eat at many local special taste stops, were pondering for many days and finally decided that we needed to be among Istanbul’s most productive ateliers, studios and many other work places with a wide variety of professions. We concluded we had to be located in this industrial neighbourhood, which, as we passed by the many ateliers, already seems to function as a natural coworking circle itself.
