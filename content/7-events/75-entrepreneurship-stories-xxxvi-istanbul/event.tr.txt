Description: 

‘Entrepreneurship is not only about commerce or earning money. Entrepreneurship is in all aspects of our life; social, professional or emotional…’’

‘Entrepreneurship Stories’ aims to create a community where people listen to entrepreneurs who share their stories and experiences, in an interactive tone, where participants are more than welcome to contribute, ask and answer. Our storytellers come from different backgrounds, professionally, culturally and nation wise.

Our primary goal is not to teach. We only aim to share. If we influence a few people on the way, that is more than enough to make us happy.

The founder of Entrepreneurship Stories, Percin Imrek and his colleagues invite you to this inspiring, fun and interactive event, where everybody is a learner and everybody can be a teacher.

The event is free of charge.
