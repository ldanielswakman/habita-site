Description: 

At the event organized by Social Maker Lab, Esin Işık, who is also one of our members, told about people oriented design, its effective methods and how it is used for social benefit. 

We tried to find answers to questions like ‘How we can understand the effects of the solutions that we have found on people’s/users’ lives?’, ‘How we can use these solutions to affect people’s lives, to address their needs, to realize their dreams and to strengthen them?’
