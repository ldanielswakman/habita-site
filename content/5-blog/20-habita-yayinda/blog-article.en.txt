We couldn't post anything for a long time beacuse there are frantic amount of things to do before the formal opening. To be frank, the beginning must be the hardest part of a project.

However, we are decisive to start posting regularly and wait for habitans to share their experiences and ideas under this blog.

So, what happened in habita during this period? 

First of all, our newsletter is online now and the september issue was sent to the subscribers! 

Furthermore, we hosted "Startup Survival Mode vs. UX" panel and 16. Startup İstanbul meet up which was organized by filhub at 5th of September.
