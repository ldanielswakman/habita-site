It doesn’t matter if you work for the largest company in the world, as a freelancer or a start up…
No matter what, in **habita** there is something for everyone who wants to feel happier while working, is in need for a fresh breath and, most importantly, wants to be a part of an ecosystem where *good things* are created all together…

Fixed desks in an open space, closed offices and flexible working places… We are waiting for new habitans!
